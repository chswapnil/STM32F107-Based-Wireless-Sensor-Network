# STM32F107-Based-Wireless-Sensor-Network

Phase 1 - Implemented a simple packet parser to parse weather packets.

Phase 2 - Decreased parsing bottleneck by implementing buffers and designing a new I/O driver to recieve and transmit data.

Phase 3 - Decreased parsing latency by implementing interrupts based I/O drivers.

Phase 4 - Improved parsing by parallelizing the task using uCOS-III (RTOS).
